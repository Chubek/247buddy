# Running the Application on Android

1. Download and install Genymotion.

2. Download and install Android Platform Tools (Genymotion has its own SDK).

3. Add the Platform Tools folder to your PATH. Also install Android SDK and add the root of it to the ANDROID_HOME. Also install JDK and add its root to JAVA_HOME.

4. After starting a Virtual Device, type "adb devices" in your terminal app and if the VD is listed, you're good to go.

5. cd to the BuddyClient folder.

6. npm i --verbose.

7. After you're done installing the dependencies, cd to the /android folder.

8. Run gradlew in the terminal.

9. cd back the root.

10. Run "npm run android".

NOTE: You need JDK 14+. JRE won't do.
